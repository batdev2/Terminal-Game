This is a simple terminal-based implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The player competes against the computer by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer makes its choice randomly. The game then determines the winner based on the traditional rules:

    Rock beats Scissors
    Scissors beats Paper
    Paper beats Rock
